# 🌫 Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction App

## 📌 Overview

The **AQI Prediction App** is a Machine Learning web application that predicts the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** based on pollutant concentration levels.

The model is trained using environmental pollution data and deployed using **Streamlit** to provide an interactive web interface where users can input pollutant values and instantly receive AQI predictions.

The application also provides **visualizations, AQI categories, and health precautions** to help users understand the air quality conditions better.

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aqi-prediction-app.git
cd aqi-prediction-app
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Train the Model

Run the following command to train the model and generate the model file.

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will create:

```
model/aqi_model.pkl
```

---

## 💻 Run the Streamlit App

Start the Streamlit application using:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open automatically in your browser.

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

The application includes visualizations to help users understand pollution levels:

* **Bar Chart** showing pollutant concentrations
* **Pie Chart** showing pollutant contribution

## 🩺 AQI Categories

| AQI Range | Category  |
| --------- | --------- |
| 0 – 50    | Good      |
| 51 – 100  | Moderate  |
| 101 – 200 | Poor      |
| 201 – 300 | Very Poor |
| 301+      | Severe    |
